## <div align="center">✅ | About the Project</div>

**Green Turkiye** is a strategy game that aims to raise awareness about environmental pollution in Turkiye and its possible solutions.

Players first select a **region** on the interactive map. Each region presents unique environmental challenges—from **landslides in the Black Sea** to **droughts in Central Anatolia**.

Once the game starts, you must react to **Event Nodes** that spawn periodically across the map to maintain regional stability. You will face the "Sustainability Trilemma," forcing you to choose the best course of action by balancing strategic trade-offs between **Budget**, **Public Happiness**, and **Environmental Health**.

Can you save nature without bankrupting the region?

## <div align="center">🚀 | Game Features</div>

### Dynamic Incident Management
Handle periodic **Event Nodes** (Crisis Indicators) that appear randomly across the map. Each node has a limited lifetime. If you ignore them, you'll face severe consequences!

### Authentic Regional Experience
Explore an interactive, SVG-based map of **Turkey** divided into 7 distinct geographical regions. Face real-world environmental challenges specific to each location.

### The Sustainability Trilemma
Every choice matters. Players must choose the best course of action for regional incidents by considering the **strategic trade-offs**. You can also **invest** in special projects to grow your budget over time.
